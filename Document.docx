Recruitment & Candidate Tracking System.


Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

1️⃣ Requirement Gathering
Goal: Clearly define what the system must achieve.
Steps:
Identify the use case: "Recruitment & Candidate Tracking System."

List functional requirements (what the system must do):
Create/manage Job Positions.
Store and track Candidate details (resume, skills, status).
Schedule Interviews linked to candidates & jobs.
Automate communication (acknowledgment, interview notifications).
Generate Reports/Dashboards (pipeline, time-to-hire, recruiter performance).

List non-functional requirements (how the system should behave):
Easy-to-use UI (LWC).
Secure (restricted access by role).
Scalable (can handle multiple recruiters, jobs, candidates).
Integratable with other systems (email, APIs).

✅ Deliverable: A requirements document (table with "Requirement → Description → Priority").


2️⃣ Stakeholder Analysis
Goal: Understand who will use the system and what they expect.
Steps:
List your stakeholders:

HR Manager → Wants approval process, dashboards, overall visibility.
Recruiter → Needs to manage job postings, candidates, and interviews.
Interviewer → Needs to see assigned interviews, provide feedback.
Candidate (external, not a Salesforce user) → Receives automated emails.
For each stakeholder, define their role, responsibilities, and pain points.

✅ Deliverable: A stakeholder matrix (Stakeholder → Role → Expectations → Pain Points).


3️⃣ Business Process Mapping
Goal: Document the current hiring process & map it to Salesforce.
Steps:

Draw an As-Is process flow (manual hiring today):
Recruiter posts job externally → Candidates email resumes → Recruiter shortlists manually → Interview scheduled via email/phone → HR updates spreadsheets → Final approval.

Draw a To-Be process flow (with Salesforce):
Job Position record created → Candidates entered into Salesforce → Automated acknowledgment → Interview scheduled in Salesforce → Automated notifications → Hiring approval process → Dashboard updates.

Tools to use:
Draw.io, Lucidchart, or even PowerPoint SmartArt for diagrams.

✅ Deliverable: A process flow diagram (As-Is vs To-Be).


4️⃣ Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Goal: Justify why Salesforce is a good platform for this solution.
Steps:

Research Recruitment Industry Trends:
Many companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) like Workday, Taleo, Lever, Greenhouse.
These are often expensive, less customizable.

Map your system against them:
Salesforce provides customization, automation, and dashboards at lower cost.
Can integrate with LinkedIn Jobs, Gmail, Outlook.
Extensible: tomorrow you can add Onboarding, Payroll, or Training on the same platform.

✅ Deliverable: A comparison table (Traditional ATS vs Salesforce-based ATS).
